# Welcome to Our Project Powered by Sanity.io

Our project leverages the power of [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/), a platform for structured content that comes with an open-source editing environment. Sanity.io allows us to treat content as data and gives us the freedom to build a project around our needs.

One of the standout features we've enabled is the **Presentation Tool**. This tool provides a live preview of your content in Sanity.io. What makes it even more awesome is its interactive nature - you can click on items directly in the preview to edit them in Sanity.io. This makes content editing a breeze!

We've also enabled **Image Hotspots** and **Image Cropping** features. These allow us to focus on the most important parts of our images and crop them to fit our design needs.

Our project includes **Blog** and **Page components**. These components make it easy to build and manage our blog posts and web pages.

And that's not all! We have much more in store for you. We hope you enjoy working with Sanity.io as much as we do!
